This project explores the implementation of a Bluetooth-based home appliance
controller, taking a step towards personalized smart home automation. The project
demonstrates the core functionalities of such a system using a miniature circuit board
equipped with a microcontroller (e.g. Arduino UNO R3 ) and an HC-05 Bluetooth module.
